# Singleton Design Pattern
>singleton pattern, allows you to instantiate an object once, and then use that one every time you need it, instead of creating a new one without having to keep track of a reference to it, either globally or just passing it as a dependency everywhere.

## Use Cases
it might be a good idea to keep that connection alive and accessible throughout your code.
